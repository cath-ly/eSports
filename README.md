# eSports vs. Traditional Sports Analysis

Using D3 and datasets, I answer the question of has eSports reached mainstream relevancy compared to traditional sports.

## Introduction

This repository focuses on my final project for CSC 160: Web, Data, and Design taught by Dr. Bradshaw. Focusing on a front-end based project that tackles the question of sports vs. eSports. Specifically we are looking into recent years (2017-2020).

## Project Detail

This project utilizes D3 JS, CSS, HTML, and datasets to beautify the webpage as well as introduce myself to the potential of front-end libraries that can help make webpages more interactive.

## Challenges

Since this was my first semester and first time ever contributing in codebase, this class felt very intense for the amount of tools I was learning within one semester. I had to understand JS and make proper logic in the webpage. Looking back now at this project, it is definitely rough and I am planning on creating cleaner code. For example, most of my JS functions are in one file. There is no clarity between functions and is very sloppy. Because of my sloppiness in the codebase, there were more issues syntax-wise and made it VERY hard to read.

## What did I learn

I learned a lot about JS, API Injections, Promises, and creating interactive webpages. Specifically hovering, onClick functions on data points, and assessing datasets. 

## Looking at the repository in 2024

After graduating, I noticed that there has been so much improvement in my code writing as well as my maintainability for scalable code. During my first two years I always talked about how proud I am at the results of this project but looking thoroughly now I realized I had so much to learn. Even now, I feel that I have a lot to learn especially whenr there is more and more frameworks coming out replacing past mainstream tools.
